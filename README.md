Thanks for reviewing and I appreciate any and all feedback!

1. Seems that this is a subscriber business model and the largest drop in retention comes between the first and second replenishment order
2. The greatest impact to revenue would be to increase the 3+ order retention by 500 basis points because of the greater share in sales from the 3+ order groups.  However, it would be easiest to implement an increase of the 3+ order AOV by $3.  The AOV increase would be the least disruptive and lowest effort by upselling the customer.  This could be achieved through selling more items per transaction (IPT) or by increaseing the Average Unit Retail (AUR). With a decent assortment and quality product it's much easier to upsell to an exisiting customer than to keep new customers.
3.I would love to see the SKU detail as well as the COGS details.  This would really help out operationally by giving greater visibility into inventory and network optimization.  By combining the SKU level, COGS, Retention, and AOV details we can gain greater insight to maximize our Supply Chain and reduce costs.
